Gameplay
*------------------*

The powerup:
    The powerup can be picked up only once unless it is being spawned
    by a powerup generator. Once picked up, the player will turn blue
    and it activating it will spawn a platform that can be stood on.
    Be careful; though, because the platform will only last a short
    amount of time before it fades away.

The door:
    The green door (sometimes a boss door) is present in all levels.
    Once the player touches the door, he or she will be warped directly
    to the next level.

Enemies:
    The smaller red enemies will wait for a little, and then charge the
    player. Touching the enemy will result in a restart of the level.

Boss:
    The final boss of the game can be killed by touching his altar five
    times. Once touched, the altar will summon a shield that takes a 
    certain amount of time to disappear. The boss will also summon death
    beams from the sky to kill the player.

Features
*------------------*

Levels:
    The original levels contain 11 maps with the last one being the final
    boss fight. The expansion pack (which can be opened through the mod
    menu) contains an additional 17 maps.

Map editor:
    The game ships with an in-game editor that can be used for editing levels
    and mods (also called packs).

Mod menu:
    In the main menu, there is a "Mods" button that opens a mod menu. This 
    menu can be used to load mods created by the map editor. Any mods in the
    folder called "packs" will be loaded when the game starts up (they will
    not be reloaded any time while the game is open).

Timer:
    The game includes a speedrun timer that can be toggled in the main menu.
    This timer is accurate down to the hundredth of a second and it tells
    exactly how many frames the run has been going on for. It also
    automatically pauses when the game is paused.
